Content-Based Music Recommendation System

Project Overview:
    This project implements a Content-Based Music Recommendation System using Machine Learning techniques in Python.
    The system recommends similar songs based on their audio features such as tempo, energy, danceability, loudness, and more.

Objectives:
    Recommend songs similar to a given input song
    Use content-based filtering
    Apply cosine similarity to measure similarity between songs
    Build a simple and explainable ML project suitable for academic use

Recommendation Technique Used:
    Content-Based Filtering
    Each song is represented as a feature vector
    Similarity between songs is calculated using Cosine Similarity
    Songs with higher similarity scores are recommended

Technologies Used:
    Programming Language:
        Python
    Libraries:
        Pandas
        NumPy
        Scikit-learn
    Algorithm:
        Cosine Similarity
        StandardScaler

Dataset Used:
    Dataset Name: spotify_tracks.csv (Download from Kaggle)
    Sample Features Used: (danceability,energy,loudness,tempo,speechiness,acousticness,instrumentalness,valence etc..)

System Workflow:
    1.Load the dataset
    2.Filter songs by language (Tamil)
    3.Select relevant audio features
    4.Normalize features using StandardScaler
    5.Compute similarity using cosine_similarity
    6.Recommend top N similar songs

Top-N Tamil Song Recommendations

Algorithm Steps:
    * Convert songs into numerical feature vectors
    * Scale features to bring them to the same range
    * Calculate cosine similarity between songs
    * Sort similarity scores in descending order
    * Recommend the most similar songs

Cosine Similarity Score:
    Cosine similarity is the primary evaluation metric used in this project.
    Formula:
        Cosine Similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
    Where:
        A and B are feature vectors of two songs
        The output ranges from 0 to 1
    Interpretation:
        Value close to 1 → Songs are very similar
        Value close to 0 → Songs are dissimilar
    Higher cosine similarity indicates better recommendation accuracy.

Future Enhancements:
    Add Collaborative Filtering
    Build a Hybrid Recommendation System
    Create a Web Application using Flask/Streamlit
    Add user login and playlists
